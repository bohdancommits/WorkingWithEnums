# WorkingWithEnums
This Java program simulates movement on a 2D grid. The Direction enum defines four directions with different costs. The `Mover` class tracks position (x, y) and total cost. It can move in a chosen direction, move randomly 10 times, and check if a move is expensive. It shows enums, random moves, and cost calculation.
